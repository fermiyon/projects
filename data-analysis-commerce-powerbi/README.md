## Waggle dataset analysis
This is a data analysis project that utilizes Microsoft PowerBI to explore the waggle dataset from Udacity.


## Description
The dataset contains information of 11,161 pets that uses either Lapcat or Lapdog devices. The following questions are investigated:

- Research Question 1 - Does the Lapcat device influence daily activity in cats to the same extent as the Lapdog device does in dogs?

- Research Question 2 - Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?

- Research Question 3 - What are the demographic differences between dogs and cats using Waggle devices, and what characteristics can be identified about the families who own these pets?

The project includes various visualisations including bar chart, line chart, donut chart, table, map, scatter plot, maps.

The project features interactive slicers, drill-downs, drill-through pages, dynamic buttons for navigation, use of corporate branding and bookmarks for visual swapping and filter resetting. 

The aim is to deliver a boardroom-ready report that answers the CEO's questions on the first page, with deeper insights on subsequent pages.
